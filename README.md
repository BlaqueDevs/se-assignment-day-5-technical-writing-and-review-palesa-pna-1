# SE-DAY5-Technical-Writing
## 1. How can understanding your audience’s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?

### **For Technical Experts:**  
- Use precise technical terminology without over-explaining basic concepts.  
- Provide in-depth details, including code snippets, system architecture, and performance benchmarks.

### **For General Audiences (Non-Experts):**  
- Use plain language and avoid jargon, or explain technical terms when necessary.  
- Provide analogies, real-world examples, and visuals to simplify complex concepts.  
- Focus on practical applications and benefits rather than intricate technical details.  

### **Balancing Both Audiences:**  
- Offer layered content: A high-level summary for general readers, with deeper technical sections for experts.
